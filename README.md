# GlobalAIEnterprise

**GlobalAIEnterprise** is a live, continuously running intelligence engine that detects **systemic public-data instability, reliability failures, and risk velocity signals** before they surface as visible impact.

This is **not** a dashboard.  
This is **not** static research.  
This is a **running economic intelligence engine**.

## What This Engine Does

GlobalAIEnterprise operates as a multi-system pipeline that:

- Scans high-impact public data sources daily  
- Detects recurring reliability failures  
- Measures signal velocity and instability growth  
- Separates **free public intelligence** from **licensed full intelligence**
- Enforces a strict API paywall at the machine level

The system is designed for **early-warning intelligence**, not hindsight analysis.
