# GlobalAIEnterprise

GlobalAIEnterprise is a **live, continuously running intelligence engine** that detects systemic **public-data instability, reliability failures, and risk velocity signals** before they surface as visible impact.

This is not a dashboard.  
This is not static research.  
This is a **running economic intelligence engine**.

## ⚠️ Founding Drop (Limited)

The **first public intelligence release** is now available.

**Founding Drop — 14 Days (Dec 17–30, 2025)**  
Early-access founding drop with limited quantity and time window.

🔗 **Discounted access (Founding link):**  
https://jathangkip.gumroad.com/l/rkrqbg/FOUNDING9

This release contains **14 consecutive days** of machine-generated reliability and risk signals derived from continuous monitoring of public data systems.

### Included in this release
- Daily reliability failure snapshots (raw, timestamped)
- Chronic failure index (recurring instability signals)
- Reliability rankings of monitored public data sources
- Velocity and recurrence indicators
- Latest machine-readable feeds (JSON + CSV)

**Important:**  
This is a **one-time downloadable intelligence bundle**, not a subscription.

## What This Engine Does

GlobalAIEnterprise operates as a multi-system pipeline that:

- Scans high-impact public data sources daily
- Detects recurring reliability failures
- Measures signal velocity and instability growth
- Separates **free public intelligence** from **licensed full intelligence**
- Enforces access control at the machine level

The system is designed for **early-warning intelligence**, not hindsight analysis.

## Access Model

### Free (Public)
- Limited summaries
- Machine-readable indicators with reduced attribution depth

### Licensed (Paid)

## Important Notes

- This is **not a subscription**
- No marketing emails
- No upsells
- No services or consulting
- Data is delivered **exactly as generated by the engine**
