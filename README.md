What This Engine Does

GlobalAIEnterprise operates as a multi-system pipeline that:

Scans high-impact public data sources daily

Detects recurring reliability failures

Measures signal velocity and instability growth

Separates free public intelligence from licensed full intelligence

Enforces access control at the machine level

The system is designed for early-warning intelligence, not hindsight analysis.
