    <h1>GlobalAIEnterprise</h1>

    <p><strong>Public-data reliability and systemic risk intelligence engine.</strong></p>

    <p>
        This is not a dashboard.<br>
        This is not academic research.<br>
        This is a continuously running intelligence engine.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Engine Does</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Monitors high-impact public data sources daily</li>
        <li>Detects reliability failures and instability patterns</li>
        <li>Measures signal velocity and escalation risk</li>
        <li>Separates free public intelligence from licensed full-risk intelligence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The system is designed for early-warning intelligence, not hindsight analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>Access</h2>

        <li><strong>Free:</strong> Public risk summaries</li>
        <li><strong>Paid:</strong> Full risk intelligence (90-day access)</li>
